# html-css-basics

Let's learn the importance of HTML and CSS markup languages, how we use it and what to consider when we build good design thats readable for users.

### Let's get started!

1. Drag and drop the `index.html` in a browser window.
1. Alternatively you can run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` in the terminal via the respective directory.

### HTML Skeletons

HTML is just markup language that is essentially the wireframe for a website. Having a good skeleton or structure is key in building the rigidy and flow of a platform. Think of it as the steel beams that you see when a building is first constructed.

### CSS Prettifying

Now here we'll pour the concrete, insert the glass panels, and paint the building all pretty. We can use CSS markup language to shape how the HTML will look like visually to a user. No matter what kind of HTML we can, CSS can manipulate it visually and convey many different ways to tell a story of a site. HTML can stay completely untouched and a site can look complete different!

We'll see this in our example here. In the `index.html` file you'll see two different css files: `badstyle.css` and `goodstyle.css`.

Comment and uncomment each respectively and see how content moves around but the information is still completely the same!

### Going further

Now let's manipulate the content of our HTML and the styles of our CSS file.

1. Change the content in `index.html` such as the `title`, `h1`, and the `p` tags.
1. Add your own CSS markup by creating a brand new file in the `css` folder called `styles.css`.
1. Try maintain good color schema and styles when reference to the HTML's respective elements, ids, and classes.
